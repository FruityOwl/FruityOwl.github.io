# Panic-PWA

Hello!

First of all, this is a clone of repository created by Nubuscu and 90% of work was done by him, so big kudos for making it! I have only updated most of text and tokens to represent newer version of the rules as we wanted to play it and thus was the best choice to track everything.

It is a simple web app to play Panic At The Dojo. This contains all the required content for a player to get started and keep track of all their tokens during the game.
